# Dominion
Hello everyone! The core of the project's is to recreate a simulated environment for playing Dominion, the famous card game by Donald X. Vaccarino.
Nevertheless, this project actual goal is twofold: allowing people to play the game in a virtual way, and at the same time developing powerful AIs and strategies, allowing to better understand the game overall.
Feel free to contribute!
